## Bike Accident Mapper

I receive daily Google Alerts about bike related news in Israel. 
I decided to start collecting data on bike accidents in which a automobile was involved.

Data collected includes:
  1. Date
  2. Type of injury (Light, Medium, Heavy, Critical, Death)
  3. Age
  4. Bike or Electric Bike (note to self: should add corcinet and other electric vehicles)
  5. Address
  
 Address is geocoded using geopy.
 
 Next stage is to create the map style.
 
 Automation required on two levels:
 1. Convert google alert to new entry.
 2. Automatically update web map
 
 This is my first personal open-source public project, so I will appreciate any tips and advice.
